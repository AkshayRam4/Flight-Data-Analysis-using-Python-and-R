# Flight-Data-Analysis-using-Python-and-R

The 2006 and 2007 years of the flights dataset from the Harvard dataverse was used for this project. Data was cleaned before conducting an in-depth analysis using the available variables. 

Data was visualised in both R and Python to answer the following research questions,

1.When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?

2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
   
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
   
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
   
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.

A linear regression model was constructed to predict future flight delays in real world scenarios.
